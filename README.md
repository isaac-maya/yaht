## Why?

Why, you might wonder, would I venture to create another habit tracker when there are already so many available? With a simple search in the App Store, you'll be flooded with a myriad of options - apps filled to the brim with enticing features such as gamification, stunning user interfaces, and cloud backups. So, why develop yet another habit tracker?

The answer lies in the essence of being a creator. Creators, by nature, are driven to bring their unique visions to life, irrespective of the crowd. This project is more than just another entry into the market of habit trackers; it's an exploration of my skills, a practical laboratory where I could experiment, learn, and grow.

Yet, it's not only about honing my skills. As an avid user of habit trackers myself, I've always sought the perfect blend of simplicity and effectiveness. Many apps I found were laden with gimmicky features, clouding the essential purpose of tracking habits. I wanted something stripped down to its essence; software that serves its core function without unnecessary distractions.

## Features

* **Daily Habit Tracking:** Daily perspective, allowing users to keep track of their habits for every day of the week. It's as simple as marking an 'X' for the day if the habit is done.

* **Add Habits:** With just a click of the "Add Habit" button, users can add a new habit to track. They simply need to input the name of the habit into the provided dialog box.

* **Delete Habits:** If a user decides they no longer want to track a certain habit, they can easily remove it from the list by selecting it and clicking the "Delete Habit" button.

*	**Interactive Table:** Habits and their progress are displayed in a table for an easy overview. It shows each habit along with its status for every day of the week. The table is interactive, allowing users to select a specific habit and day to mark as completed. It can be updated by simply clicking on a specific cell or using the Space key for the currently selected habit and day.

*	**Simple and Clean UI:** The user interface of the application is straightforward and distraction-free, focusing on functionality over aesthetics.
